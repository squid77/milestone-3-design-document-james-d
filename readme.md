# M3 Project Design Document

Your team is submitting a design document that should include solid plans for applying information visualization techniques we have discussed in class to your proposed data set. This document primarily consists of an exploration of the design space for creating a visualization from your data.

## Your document(s) must include:

### Project title and team
Include names and email addresses of all people on this project team

### Infovis Solution [4 pages]
You should propose an infovis solution that clearly shows you have spent some time exploring the design space. To this end, you will follow the [five sheet design method](http://fds.design/). Each sheet serves a specific purpose. We will spend some time in class discussing this method. Note: You do not have to use the templates that are provided, but your individual pages should contain the same general content.

#### Sheet 1: Brainstorming
The idea of brain‐storming is to enlarge the design space of possibilities. There should be a focus on quantity – to generate as many designs as you can think of. This should be a group activity. Once you have these ideas, filter down to the most promising ones, categorize them, attempt to merge them into more powerful view combinations. [\[Detailed Description\]]( http://fds.design/index.php/2015/06/25/sheet-1-brain-storm/)

#### Sheets 2, 3, 4: Details for three separate ideas
The three individual design sheets are to record three ideas from the initial brain‐storming exercise. You should choose your three most promising ideas to expand with more detail. These individual sheets can be done with your group or assigned to individual members to complete on their own. These include a general layout or wireframe for the visualization method, details for how the visualization system works, a description of the interactions available to the user (buttons, drop downs, query boxes, etc.), and a discussion of the benefits and challenges of the chosen technique. I want to know who did what - there should be space on each sheet for the name of the person(s) who worked on that particular design.

### Poster (Sheet 5: Realization)
Once you have completed your three individual designs, you should come together with your group to decide on one final idea to champion. This visualization may draw primarily from one of the designs, or it may include elements from all of them. The page you will submit for this final realized design will include a list of milestones with dates - what are the big stepping stones that need to be completed for this design to be successful within the remaining semester? The page should also include some basic implementation details - what packages, software libraries, or online tutorials are you planning to rely on to build this visualization? Will you need a database connection, or will you load everything in the browser? [\[Detailed Description\]](http://fds.design/index.php/2015/06/25/sheet-5-realization-design/)

This poster should be a standard 3x4 feet. You may feel free to choose portrait or landscape orientation. This will be printed, either in the library or elsewhere, but CANNOT consist of printed or hand drawn pages affixed to a poster board or a large sheet of paper. As such, you should be careful to adjust the type of your poster accordingly, hand-drawn text from any scanned sheets should be covered and replaced with legible typed text. Magnified hand-drawn images / diagrams are fine as long as they are legible.

### Submission
One design document per project team is due at the start of class on the due date as a submission to your team's repository for this milestone and as a physical printout of the poster. Submissions should be in pdf form, no more than five pages long. You should include scans or high-resolution images of your four sheets in your pdf. Your poster can be included in the PDF or a separate pdf, either is fine.
